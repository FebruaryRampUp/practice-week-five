## Practice Problems

#### Iteration Practice

1. Add 3 to each element in an array [1, 2, 3, 4] with two different techniques.

2. Print every capital letter from A to Z.

3. `a = [1, 2, 3]` and `b = ["a", "b", "c"]`. Print out 1a, 1a, 1c, 2a, 2b, 2c, 3a, 3b, 3c

4. Write a linear search algorithm for an unsorted list without using any array methods other than Array#length.

5. `people = [["Prathap", "cool dude"], ["Justin", "good singer"]] ` Iterate through the people array and print the following sentences on separate lines:  `Prathap is a cool dude.`  `Justin is a good singer.`

6. Leap Years: Write a program which will ask for a starting year and an ending year, and then puts all of the leap years between them (and including them, if they are also leap years).

Leap years are years divisible by four (like 1984 and 2004). However, years divisible by 100 are not leap years (such as 1800 and 1900) unless they are divisible by 400 (like 1600 and 2000, which were in fact leap years).

7. Write a program which asks us to type in as many words as we want (one word per line, continuing until we just press Enter on an empty line), and which then repeats the words back to us in alphabetical order.
